In this project, we tackled the challenge of creating a system capable of filtering case data directly from the SÃ£o Paulo Court of Justice website, extracting key information, storing it in a database, and providing back-end and front-end interfaces for management, functioning similarly to a case management agency.

Initially, we developed web scraping in Python, primarily using the Selenium library to access and extract the necessary data.

Additionally, we implemented a robust back-end that manages system users, cases, and authentication tokens, including refresh tokens for enhanced security.

On the front-end, we created a login system and a Kanban-style board with cards representing each extracted case. Users can move the cards between different stages: 'New Publications', 'Read Publications', 'Publications Sent to Attorneys', and 'Completed', providing a clear and interactive view of the workflow.
